## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#466](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/466) [`fc3c65f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/fc3c65f05a56d6a3bcf331b459e9383499122719) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Strip auto-injected memory/context plugin blocks before compaction summarization.

  Memory and context plugins (`active-memory`, `memory-lancedb`, `hindsight-openclaw`, etc.) prepend XML-tagged blocks to user messages via the `prependContext` hook. Without stripping, the compaction summarizer treats these ephemeral retrieval blocks as real conversation content, permanently corrupting summaries.

  New `stripInjectedContextTags` config option (string array, defaults to well-known plugin tags). Override via plugin config or `LCM_STRIP_INJECTED_CONTEXT_TAGS` env var. Set to `[]` to disable.

### Patch Changes

- [#788](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/788) [`a637fd3`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a637fd31bf1dca49e585cf25d21af02af70f6050) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add a per-session summarization spend guard and back off failed deferred compaction retries to avoid repeated non-auth model spend.

- [#715](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/715) [`57afa5c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/57afa5caf96aab5789d386fb4d7249f8ae879004) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep deferred threshold compaction off the normal next-turn assemble path.

  Pending deferred compaction debt is now left for the after-turn background drain
  or host-approved maintenance while the live prompt is still within the active
  token budget. `assemble()` only drains pending debt synchronously as an
  emergency safeguard when the live prompt estimate is already over budget,
  without turning ordinary threshold debt into foreground latency.

- [#768](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/768) [`535f4e2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/535f4e2b0fcfaa2be7942e74d22ddcf60ee890bb) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Restrict delegated sub-agent retrieval tools to the conversation IDs in their expansion grant. Sub-agents can no longer use `allConversations=true` or an explicit foreign `conversationId` to bypass the grant scope in `lcm_grep`, `lcm_describe`, `lcm_expand`, or `lcm_expand_query`.

- [#805](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/805) [`3ef191b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3ef191bc3098f66e531c119e6a9e3d5948d82e05) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Mark engine emergency fallback summaries with the normal fallback marker and teach `/lossless doctor` to flag legacy unmarked emergency truncation summaries for repair.

- [#801](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/801) [`3740efa`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3740efa3795e024030539d8cfc1c7006e6c645b2) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Escape assembled summary XML content and identifiers so persisted summary text cannot break out of the untrusted historical context wrapper.

- [#792](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/792) [`9cd6630`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9cd66306c3fde49ddfc3ea23065b35c0200a98ff) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fail closed when a stable session key resumes under a new runtime session and transcript while the prior tracked transcript still exists.

- [#787](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/787) [`71bf277`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/71bf277713d7ae7eb346738d43bc2b3c9122deb2) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Skip leaked OpenClaw runtime context assistant messages before LCM persistence.

- [#785](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/785) [`9f5c1aa`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9f5c1aa725b1e800e53b1f89781b9accac18e0a9) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Document and test bounded LCM bootstrap behavior for forked child transcripts, and advertise the host thread-bootstrap projection requirement for subagent forks.

- [#137](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/137) [`ed88b09`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ed88b094c259cb5b7adfb4276cf0278d8f73be85) Thanks [@hhe48203-ctrl](https://github.com/hhe48203-ctrl)! - Harden summarization and assembly against prompt-injection persistence (issue [#71](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/71)).

  Injected directives embedded in conversation history could survive compaction and be
  replayed in later turns. This change defends the content layer end to end:

  - The summarizer system prompt no longer instructs the model to "follow user
    instructions exactly"; it now treats all conversation text as untrusted data and
    must strip embedded directives, role reassignments, and behavioral overrides.
  - Every leaf/condensed summarization prompt (D1/D2/D3+) marks its input as
    UNTRUSTED DATA so the summarizer extracts facts without obeying embedded
    instructions.
  - Assembled summaries carry a `trust="untrusted"` taint label on the `<summary>`
    tag, and the runtime recall system prompt tells the model not to follow any
    instructions found within summary content.

  Summaries are still reinserted with the `user` role. Downgrading the role
  (issue [#71](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/71) recommendation 1) requires OpenClaw upstream support — `toolResult`
  is dropped by tool-result pairing sanitation and `assistant` risks provider
  first-message/alternation constraints — and is tracked as follow-up.

- [#814](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/814) [`0fd64a4`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0fd64a456ea997929ced1383ac5e3a06de966cf4) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Isolate cron scheduler runs that reuse a stable session key so prior run transcripts do not enter the new run's LCM context.

- [#812](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/812) [`7e7d449`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7e7d44960290fddc51659619e6125298b80632f8) Thanks [@tadad](https://github.com/tadad)! - Include conversation IDs on each `lcm_grep` message and summary result so agents can disambiguate global recall hits.

- [#790](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/790) [`1f688c6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1f688c60de16169cddf7b0fb68df0a872070e118) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Preserve assistant top-level `reasoning_content` during LCM ingest and replay,
  including tool-call-only assistant messages from Kimi/DeepSeek-style thinking
  providers. The field is restored as top-level assistant metadata, kept out of
  visible `content` blocks and compaction summarizer input, and still included in
  token accounting.

- [#813](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/813) [`a4b5fa0`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a4b5fa067f200776f3b495f04df7271288fca11d) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Skip Lossless runtime startup work during OpenClaw CLI metadata registration so help and JSON inspection commands do not emit misleading runtime LLM warnings.

- [#770](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/770) [`191568a`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/191568af9b905434cf46cc7d35b6b9d0c1822c38) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Normalize ChatCompletion-style summarizer responses from reasoning-capable providers by reading `choices[].message.content` without storing or logging reasoning/thinking fields as summary text.

- [#802](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/802) [`b7c44da`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b7c44dabfd37a22ec7167ea1aee7beda53f8f5e5) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Backfill release-note coverage for recent safety and reliability fixes that shipped without individual changesets.

  This release includes additional hardening for threshold raw-backlog projection, hot-maintenance assembly degradation, OpenClaw context-engine compatibility checks, doctor apply preflight safety, archived conversation reattachment avoidance, rotate/reconcile idempotency, and prompt-recall behavior after transcript rotation.

- [#767](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/767) [`5dd0353`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5dd0353536588054038a0c4d9c81a03628964663) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Force leaf-only compaction for raw context outside the preserved fresh tail before rotating session transcripts.

- [#761](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/761) [`640a0a8`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/640a0a869c8b2b172257ed8edcf3b19ba325cc8b) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Defer runtime auto-rotate JSONL rewrites out of `afterTurn` and `maintain` so embedded prompt-lock fences are not tripped during tool-call loops. Runtime checks now log a deferral to startup/manual rotation unless OpenClaw provides a host-owned full-transcript rewrite primitive. Transcript GC waits for host-approved background maintenance before invoking `rewriteTranscriptEntries`.

- [#800](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/800) [`cd79ae5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/cd79ae52544872bf9da0d14d8458653d2d246d4b) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Sanitize deterministic emergency fallback summaries so directive-shaped untrusted content is not persisted when model-backed summarization is unavailable or cannot produce a smaller summary.

- [#783](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/783) [`cd6822f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/cd6822f49076af31b6148ee14565a74fc9e355cb) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Allow LCM SQLite handles to explicitly enable extension loading for sqlite-vec on node:sqlite hosts.

### Patch Changes

- [#740](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/740) [`6ecc595`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6ecc595165c43d7639edabb22efd40297043d416) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Declare the OpenClaw context-engine host capability requirement so unsupported CLI harnesses fail with a descriptive error.

- [#750](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/750) [`f517e95`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f517e9544b57c0ce9bb5420a7a9bb95244149fae) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Forward host runtime auth profile context through Lossless summary and doctor repair calls.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- [#714](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/714) [`561b275`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/561b27562e318f3b6c8daa3f8011d836d75d13a4) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Remove a stale stable-orphan invalidation call from afterTurn placeholder-checkpoint recovery. Stable orphan stripping was removed with the cache-state-dependent assembly path, but the placeholder recovery branch still referenced the deleted method and could throw `clearStableOrphanStrippingOrdinal is not a function` during transcript reconcile.

- [#712](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/712) [`67b7f51`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/67b7f515eb66d662b7b0e85fe4aa49dfcd56b83c) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Bound `compactFullSweep` so a single compaction cannot hang the agent turn. The leaf/condensed pass loop now stops at a hard iteration cap (`maxSweepIterations`, default 12) and a wall-clock deadline (`sweepDeadlineMs`, default 120000), returning the consistent partial result instead of running unbounded passes. The sweep also yields the Node event loop between its synchronous `node:sqlite` scans so a long sweep cannot freeze the gateway for its whole duration. Both limits are configurable via plugin config or `LCM_MAX_SWEEP_ITERATIONS` / `LCM_SWEEP_DEADLINE_MS`.

  Also bound the whole `compactUntilUnder` overflow-recovery operation. It runs up to `maxRounds` sweeps, and each sweep re-arms its own `sweepDeadlineMs`, so without an operation-wide budget the worst case was `maxRounds × sweepDeadlineMs` (~20 minutes at the defaults). `compactUntilUnder` now computes one wall-clock deadline (`compactUntilUnderDeadlineMs`, default 300000), shares it into every round's sweep so a sweep stops at whichever deadline is sooner, and checks it before starting the next round — returning the consistent partial result on expiry. Configurable via plugin config or `LCM_COMPACT_UNTIL_UNDER_DEADLINE_MS`.

- [#717](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/717) [`23c91d5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/23c91d57643bd54005e802693ec7bbb13343f0e9) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Advertise and honor a longer `lcm_expand_query` dynamic tool timeout so delegated recall does not outlive OpenClaw's tool RPC watchdog.

- [#672](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/672) [`7741606`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7741606957597d03c82be1e4da91b197bdad07e6) Thanks [@holgergruenhagen](https://github.com/holgergruenhagen)! - Shorten the `/lossless` native command description so Discord no longer truncates it during command registration.

- [#709](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/709) [`78697ce`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/78697ced6be0922f7173cfb3fe0d6638416b9f95) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Keep generated focus briefs usable when they are shorter than the target length, surfacing a warning instead of failing the command after generation.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#692](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/692) [`a13905a`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a13905a832bfe843de472cb408222bed1b5f8ca7) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add focus brief generation through `/lossless focus <prompt>`, active focus overlays, unfocus/refocus lifecycle handling, and TUI/status diagnostics for generated briefs.

### Patch Changes

- [#688](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/688) [`d1bef05`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d1bef053326bd65e2736889ef4fa916f6e8bf1ec) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Preserve unpersisted OpenClaw inter-session live input when assembling context from LCM's durable DB frontier.

- [#685](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/685) [`a6640b6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a6640b648fc87d895b94ee277a9218a1f4a735a8) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Seed a placeholder `conversation_bootstrap_state` row in the afterTurn slow-path stat-fail branch so the next turn can recover.

  `[#649](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/649)` added a stat-fail fallback that returns `hasOverlap:true` to permit live `afterTurn` persistence even when `stat(sessionFile)` fails, expecting the subsequent `refreshAfterTurnBootstrapState` hook to refresh the checkpoint. That hook calls `refreshBootstrapState`, which independently calls `stat(sessionFile)` and throws on failure, so the catch block in the hook swallows the error and `conversation_bootstrap_state` stays `NULL`. Every subsequent `afterTurn` then re-enters the slow path with `reason="checkpoint-missing"`, which is intentionally excluded from `allowNoAnchorImport`, and the conversation gets stuck: LCM degrades into a transparent passthrough where the assemble safe-fallback returns `params.messages` verbatim and compaction never runs.

  This restores the contract that "permissive return ⟹ checkpoint exists" without re-introducing the unconditional refresh `[#649](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/649)` deliberately removed. The placeholder is written via `summaryStore.upsertConversationBootstrapState` directly so it does not depend on stat success. Subsequent turns recover from offset=0 once the transcript becomes statable, but route that placeholder recovery through the existing DB-anchor reconciliation path so already-persisted live afterTurn messages are not replayed as new rows.

- [#704](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/704) [`f806bb9`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f806bb9691dd58fd6e19c70091cef9ba0f001718) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Declare OpenClaw 2026.5.12 as the minimum supported host version for runtime LLM summarization.

- [#696](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/696) [`1869c6c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/1869c6c574e02e54ae1d69f94263e374de06234b) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Mark OpenClaw as an optional peer dependency so standalone plugin installs do not pull a second OpenClaw runtime tree.

- [#573](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/573) [`5621e8f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5621e8f2f37c0f5f9ee68e2334d6ab43d3887a06) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Generalize the native-image-block externalizer to assistant, system, tool, and toolResult messages. PR [#521](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/521) in v0.9.3 only ran on user-role messages, so:

  - Assistant or system messages carrying native `{type:"image", data:...}` blocks fell through to the generic raw-payload externalizer and were stored as `raw-{role}-payload.json` blobs with embedded base64 instead of dedupe-friendly image files.
  - Tool and toolResult messages (which skip raw-payload externalization entirely) had their image blocks persisted inline through the standard `message_parts` pipeline, embedding base64 directly in the DB row.

  In both cases the result was the same: no large*file row, no `lcm_describe` rendering, and no inter-conversation dedupe. The interceptor now runs for every persistable role, replacing native image blocks with `[<Role> image: ... | LCM file: file*…]` references and storing the image file once.

  `interceptLargeRawPayload` also no longer skips externalization based on a content substring match (`isExternalizedReferenceContent`); it now only skips when the message already carries the explicit `rawPayloadExternalized: true` flag, so a still-oversized message that merely embeds an image reference alongside other content is still externalized.

  Extension map: added `image/heic`, `image/avif`, and `image/bmp` so MIME-detection misses for those formats produce a sensible filename.

### Patch Changes

- [#631](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/631) [`b6568da`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b6568daa91cea86c043ba6da34623f4b564f09ee) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Disable SQLite backups during automatic session-file rotation by default. Set `autoRotateSessionFiles.createBackups` to `true` to keep automatic runtime and startup rotation creating the rolling `rotate-latest` backup; manual `/lcm rotate` still creates that backup by default.

- [#640](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/640) [`85ba63d`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/85ba63d2d70d9e4fb74d1f304a94bc36063d544d) Thanks [@0xopaque](https://github.com/0xopaque)! - Prevent existing-conversation bootstrap from replaying prior transcript rows as fresh LCM messages. Bootstrap append/reconcile now filters replay-shaped tails, message writes reject same-timestamp prior-content floods, and ingest batches run transactionally.

- [#661](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/661) [`4f78d92`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4f78d9226a188c6fef1f03b06c03d525fac446bf) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Preserve hot prompt-cache deferral for direct OpenAI GPT models and raise the default critical budget pressure ratio to 0.90 so normal threshold compaction does not immediately bypass cache protection.

- [#622](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/622) [`36c47d1`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/36c47d1dbfd98258912e0bc883be703afc024ca6) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Treat existing `cold-cache-catchup` compaction debt as legacy threshold work. Background, assemble, and host-approved maintain drains now revalidate old non-threshold debt against `contextThreshold`, run a threshold full sweep when still needed, or clear the debt when the conversation is already under threshold.

- [#621](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/621) [`a81bb34`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a81bb34b869b4b3d1e0d52d248a499be7d45c3e5) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix `afterTurn` skipping compaction evaluation when `ingestBatch` is empty. When `deduplicateAfterTurnBatch` removed every new message (e.g. because `afterTurnTranscriptReconcile` or per-message `engine.ingest` calls had already imported them), `afterTurn` would early-return before reaching the compaction policy block. Long-running conversations could accumulate well beyond `contextThreshold` without ever triggering threshold compaction, deferred-compaction debt, or budget-trigger recovery — leaving the host's emergency overflow truncation as the only safety net. The early-return is now replaced with a fall-through: when `ingestBatch` is empty the actual `ingestBatch` call is skipped, but token-budget resolution, conversation lookup, and the existing compaction evaluation flow still run. This is observable in the `[lcm] afterTurn: nothing to ingest …` log line, which now ends with `(continuing to compaction evaluation; transcript reconcile may have already ingested)`.

The plugin's bundled `dist/index.js` imports these unconditionally (build externalizes the PI scope), so absence becomes a hard `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at module load. Treating them as runtime dependencies makes the plugin self-contained on `npm install` and removes the host-symlink workaround currently required on fresh OpenClaw installs.

  - Restore the reference-inequality contract on the no-user-turn assemble fallback. PR [#502](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/502)'s guard returned `params.messages` by reference, defeating the `installContextEngineLoopHook` `assembled.messages !== sourceMessages` check installed by PR [#504](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/504); the guard now uses the same `safeFallback()` helper as the other fallback paths so the gateway treats the result as assembled context.
  - Strip assistant messages whose only blocks are blank text (`[{type:"text", text:""}]`) during assembly, complementing the existing thinking-only filter so Bedrock no longer rejects with `The text field in the ContentBlock object at messages.N.content.0 is blank`.
  - Stop redirecting paid OpenAI API-key Codex users from `https://api.openai.com/v1` to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`. `shouldUseNativeCodexBaseUrl` now respects an explicitly-configured baseUrl; the rewrite still applies when baseUrl is empty or already a ChatGPT Codex variant.
  - Remove the silent `http://localhost:11434` ollama fallback in `inferBaseUrlFromProvider` so cloud-only ollama configs (`https://ollama.com`) and self-hosted setups must be explicit; the prior default would silently route cloud configs to localhost.

- [#574](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/574) [`f986c29`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f986c29ca961e9d878a897e42d5f187ced182bd9) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Tighten packaging guards to prevent the silent-load failure mode [#555](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/555) fixed:

  - Add `test/manifest.test.ts` that asserts `openclaw.plugin.json#contracts.tools` matches the canonical `name:` fields exported by `src/tools/lcm-*-tool.ts` (discovered dynamically via directory scan, no hard-coded list) and the `registerTool` call sites in `src/plugin/index.ts` (matcher tolerates both arrow-expression and arrow-block bodies). Catches drift the next time a tool is added or renamed without a manifest update.
  - Tighten `peerDependencies` for `@mariozechner/pi-*` from `*` to `>=0.66 <1`, and `openclaw` from `*` to `>=2026.2.17 <2026.6.0`, so the next major silently mismatches at install-time rather than at runtime.
  - Add an upper bound (`<2026.6.0`) and a `tested: ["2026.5.2"]` array to `package.json#openclaw.compat`, so `openclaw plugins doctor` can flag known-incompatible host versions.
  - Add a CI smoke job that builds the bundle, installs `openclaw@latest` alongside, and verifies the bundle still imports cleanly with a callable `register` export. (A deeper smoke that drives `plugin.register(...)` against a stub api turned out to require more host-runtime fixture than is reasonable to maintain in CI; the deeper "register against the real openclaw plugin loader" check is followup work — see [#555](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/555) for the regression class that would warrant it.)
  - The Windows installer's hook-pack detector ([#451](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/451)) already saw `kind: "context-engine"` in the manifest; this is now covered by an explicit assertion in the manifest drift test.

  Closes [#570](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/570).

- [#576](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/576) [`9f55419`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9f554194fe04f6e002da3aeab611e893fa92a790) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Harden the afterTurn-lane robustness:

  - `scheduleDeferredCompactionDebtDrain` no longer silently skips when `compactionTelemetry` lacks provider/model — CLI-backend sessions ([#472](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/472)) accumulated debt forever. Now drains anyway when telemetry is missing (let the inner cache-aware gate decide), keeping silent debt off the floor. The visibility log is deduped to once per conversation per process so long-running CLI sessions don't spam every afterTurn.
  - `messageContentCoveredBySummary` (PR [#551](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/551)) replaces bare substring match with anchored-or-quoted matching — a 24+ char user instruction coincidentally appearing inside a long narrative summary is no longer silently dropped. The quote-span scan is also more resilient: an unmatched opening quote skips past instead of aborting the entire scan, so later well-formed quoted spans still get checked.
  - `reconcileTranscriptTailForAfterTurn` (PR [#551](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/issues/551)) slow path no longer blindly re-reads the full session file when checkpoint is missing or path mismatched — refresh checkpoint and switch to incremental reads, with a one-shot warn for visibility. The dedupe set is bounded with FIFO eviction at 4096 entries so hosts churning through many sessions don't accumulate it indefinitely. The empty-`historicalMessages` branch now distinguishes "actually empty file" (size 0 → refresh checkpoint) from "non-empty file but parser failure" (size > 0 → emit warn, skip checkpoint refresh, keep the next afterTurn eligible to retry).

### Patch Changes

Previously, mutation-sensitive providers (Anthropic, Codex, Copilot) could livelock the dispatcher in high-velocity sessions: each turn refreshed `lastCacheTouchAt`, the cache TTL never expired, deferred work never fired, and the runtime emergency overflow handler was left to do all the work. The new escape preserves cache-aware throttling in the 0–70% headroom band while ensuring compaction always fires before overflow.

  When a session begins with an agent greeting before any user message and the Anthropic
  prompt cache goes cold (>5 min), `assemble()` could return a context containing only
  the assistant greeting with no user turns. Providers that require conversations to end
  with a user message would then reject the LLM call, silently dropping the user's first
  real message.

  `assemble()` now detects when the assembled context contains no user-role messages at
  all (raw-message-only DB state where every stored message is `assistant` or `toolResult`)
  and falls back to the live context, which correctly ends with the user's current message.
  Sessions with compaction summaries are unaffected because summaries are always stored
  with `role: "user"`.

- [#501](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/501) [`ab22632`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ab2263215877c59738ce3e6d7608274147290aa7) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Move `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, and `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` from `dependencies` to optional `peerDependencies` so the plugin always resolves them from the host OpenClaw runtime instead of a pinned local copy.

  Previously these packages were pinned as `dependencies` (fixed at `0.66.1`), which caused npm to install a snapshot in the plugin's own `node_modules/`. That snapshot's internal path references (e.g. `provider.runtime-BlZSfz5M.js`) became stale whenever OpenClaw shipped a new build that bumped `pi-*`, breaking plugin registration on `openclaw ≥ 2026.4.20`.

  By declaring them as optional peer dependencies:

  - No local copy is installed (npm v7+ skips optional peer deps when they are not required by the consumer), so the host-provided versions are resolved via normal Node.js module lookup.
  - The build already marks `@mariozechner/*` as external (`--external:"@mariozechner/*"`), so the runtime was always intended to supply these modules.
  - `devDependencies` retains the pinned `0.66.1` versions so local builds and tests continue to work without needing a live OpenClaw installation.

- [#455](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/455) [`370b91b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/370b91b58033a890f5ff9e97fd2a950a50618ba4) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Wrap SQLite migrations in a single exclusive transaction so concurrent startup agents serialize migration work instead of racing on per-statement autocommit writes.

- [#433](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/433) [`5c8ef34`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5c8ef34ff6baf551a42c73dc1b217a3bb4828891) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Apply content-recency sorting consistently to CJK summary full-text search so recent summarized content does not lose to older but stronger trigram matches.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#408](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/408) [`abf31da`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/abf31da5a5978fc40096699dbb1f52f97d766aaa) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Added deferred proactive compaction as the default mode, with explicit maintenance debt tracking and status visibility so foreground turns no longer run threshold compaction inline unless compatibility mode is enabled.

- [#355](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/355) [`6e9388c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6e9388c17036caa6021ab075e4d91ee928d73986) Thanks [@LanicBlue](https://github.com/LanicBlue)! - Externalize inline base64 images before large tool-result text compaction, and add `largeFilesDir` / `LCM_LARGE_FILES_DIR` so externalized payload storage can be configured explicitly.

### Patch Changes

- [#403](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/403) [`ea7d532`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ea7d5327d648790350724c15990b5c1ab98bf611) Thanks [@jetd1](https://github.com/jetd1)! - Convert bootstrap's file I/O off the Node.js event loop. `readFileSegment` and `readLastJsonlEntryBeforeOffset` previously used sync `openSync`/`readSync`/`statSync`, which could block the gateway for minutes while scanning multi-MB JSONL transcripts during the bootstrap append-only path. The bootstrap entry `statSync` and `refreshBootstrapState` helper are now async as well. The backward-scan loop now only reads new chunks when the current carry has no more newlines, and the fast path short-circuits before the backward scan when the DB's latest hash no longer matches the checkpoint (the common case during active sessions, where the scan can never succeed).

- [#395](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/395) [`2c05599`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/2c05599c7ac6977be47b3358589c8a43332b2d23) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add `/lcm backup` and `/lcm rotate` plugin commands so users can snapshot the SQLite database on demand and split oversized active LCM conversations without changing their live OpenClaw session identity. Rotation now checkpoints the current transcript frontier so the fresh row starts from now forward instead of replaying older transcript history.

- [#425](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/425) [`3faa9bd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3faa9bdb04c5fc01833a2b64a478f224254793a0) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Report the canonical `lossless-claw` context-engine id from the runtime engine metadata so newer OpenClaw builds accept the plugin's registered engine slot.

- [#420](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/420) [`e0fa375`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e0fa375ae6fcd5964dae56cadf368e1718649128) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix `/lcm rotate` so it waits for the live database connection to become idle, takes a faithful pre-rotate backup on that connection, and then compacts the current session transcript without replacing the active LCM conversation. Rotation now preserves the existing conversation id, summaries, and context items while refreshing bootstrap state so dropped transcript history is not replayed.

- [#415](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/415) [`7668717`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7668717ba3790c208baa8bcb9c4f2ae4f35d7910) Thanks [@ryanngit](https://github.com/ryanngit)! - Handle conversation creation races on active session keys without crashing the caller.

- [#413](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/413) [`347add7`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/347add70429ab64b81e2191afa354857e03fd16f) Thanks [@ryanngit](https://github.com/ryanngit)! - Increase the SQLite busy timeout to 30 seconds to better tolerate concurrent writer contention without spurious `SQLITE_BUSY` failures.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- [#400](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/400) [`1711957`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/17119577e847750f3c08ab84e47e0e6628bca9ed) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Strip comments from the pre-bundled dist/index.js so the OpenClaw install-time code safety scanner no longer flags JSDoc prose (e.g. "Fetch all context items") as a network-send pattern and blocks installation with an `env-harvesting` false positive.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- [#379](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/379) [`7f42703`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/7f4270327ac22cc9028ff4261d44b53561d93a50) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve the `session_id` fallback conversation lookup by adding the matching composite index so SQLite can satisfy the latest-conversation query without a scan and temp sort.

- [#366](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/366) [`f4177ec`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f4177ec9f06af3dbc9da5241288f62e61bcd26c0) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix bootstrap recovery when a session rotates to a new transcript file so stale summaries and checkpoints are cleared before re-importing the replacement session history.

- [#376](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/376) [`06a05e5`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/06a05e515828cc99c4bbd1ceb4edfaa40f869264) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add startup diagnostics that attribute resolved ignore/stateless pattern sources, and warn when env-backed pattern arrays override plugin config arrays.

- [#353](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/353) [`6fa2829`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/6fa2829929c14f0c3175efd59a4df68c0e5b8d45) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Pre-bundle the plugin to `dist/index.js` using esbuild before publishing. This eliminates the per-invocation TypeScript compilation overhead caused by OpenClaw's JITI loader recursively transpiling every `.ts` source file, reducing CLI startup latency from 15–25 s to near-instant.

- [#354](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/354) [`b0ad788`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/b0ad78872e3f51fe6b1b1bed0a9c93e8e439554e) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Honor `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` for the default database, large-file storage, auth-profile, and legacy secret paths so multi-profile OpenClaw gateways do not read and write each other's state.

- [#380](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/380) [`33ecb88`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/33ecb8828b6f6258b6884da15e5750af07a0f846) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Stop rerunning startup summary and tool-call backfills after they complete successfully, while still retrying the same backfill version cleanly if startup fails before the completion marker is written.

- [#371](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/371) [`597ec70`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/597ec700f09660aa58899ef6ef3f37d19112e0df) Thanks [@holgergruenhagen](https://github.com/holgergruenhagen)! - Avoid treating omitted LCM summarizer reasoning settings like reasoning-disabled requests for reasoning-capable models by applying a low default only when the resolved model supports reasoning.

- [#377](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/377) [`3b2d34c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3b2d34c4e68601e37ce3b012bb38ae4ca5e977af) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add an opt-in `transcriptGcEnabled` config flag, defaulting it to `false`, and skip transcript-GC rewrites during `maintain()` unless the flag is enabled. Also add startup diagnostics and documentation for the new setting.

- [#387](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/387) [`5113044`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/5113044bbbea5af36324e2a546c5adc40b8aabb2) Thanks [@oguzbilgic](https://github.com/oguzbilgic)! - Refresh the bootstrap checkpoint after normal `afterTurn()` ingestion so persistent sessions can keep using the append-only bootstrap fast path after real conversation turns.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [`d1a9eb3`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d1a9eb36b543050bdda442faab93bab48bd3e130) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix conversation integrity regressions by pruning heartbeat-shaped ACK turns before compaction, avoiding synthetic compaction telemetry in canonical transcript history, and deduplicating replayed history using stable session key continuity during afterTurn processing.

- [#255](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/255) [`a1bda9b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/a1bda9becb9914af8cfc5c091ef7f6bcdbdbf199) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Limit first-time fork bootstrap imports so new conversations only inherit the newest slice of raw parent history instead of loading the entire parent transcript into lossless memory.

- [#258](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/258) [`cd18739`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/cd18739b08410e5c1e4dcd529afb6016a48bf303) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Add regression coverage for bootstrap budget edge cases and invalid numeric env fallback behavior.

- [#222](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/222) [`d8261d7`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/d8261d74ec9c9d866045b4283034f123f38b5d81) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Block overlapping `lcm_expand_query` delegations from the same origin session so concurrent expansion requests fail fast instead of deadlocking on the shared sub-agent lane.

- [#257](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/257) [`ea43f58`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ea43f58746cf8c96b8feb5a9f6b8a1fe02477573) Thanks [@100yenadmin](https://github.com/100yenadmin)! - Fix the hardened `afterTurn()` replay dedup path so it ingests the intended post-turn batch, and add coverage for restart replay when an auto-compaction summary is present.

- [#180](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/180) [`ea84f45`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ea84f454a07d205ff225b5c73d4f91f73e2614bd) Thanks [@GodsBoy](https://github.com/GodsBoy)! - Fix prompt-aware context eviction so blank or otherwise unsearchable prompts fall back to the existing chronological behavior instead of entering the relevance-scoring path.

- [#178](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/178) [`0613b7f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/0613b7fc7707a4ccea1ffbf7d2c8be82bd4dcee6) Thanks [@catgodtwno4](https://github.com/catgodtwno4)! - Fix summarizer auth-error detection so real provider auth envelopes nested under `data` or `body` still trigger handling, while successful summary payloads in `message` or `response` no longer cause false-positive auth failures.

- [#242](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/242) [`3fe823f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/3fe823f4dcec720c158f712fa4c4487482e80ade) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Move static lossless recall policy guidance into the plugin prompt hook while keeping `systemPromptAddition` limited to session-specific compaction reminders.

  This makes the stable recall-order guidance cacheable, clarifies that lossless-claw takes precedence over generic memory recall only for compacted conversation history, and leaves deep-compaction expand-before-asserting guidance in the dynamic assembled prompt.

- [#252](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/252) [`e843638`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/e8436388311e110b983d280e2157a9f013e41d4e) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Sync the published plugin manifest schema with the runtime-supported plugin config surface so documented config keys are accepted by OpenClaw. This also removes the undocumented `autocompactDisabled` setting from the advertised config surface because it was parsed but not wired to runtime behavior.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- [#223](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/223) [`028f171`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/028f17182350c120bf94f81781be3c9fbf11b206) Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Expose `leafChunkTokens` as a first-class plugin config option so deployments can tune leaf compaction frequency without patching the plugin manifest.

- [#220](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/220) [`8f84d8e`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/8f84d8ebfbe2163e6624fffa7468ef0de928a9da) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve LongMemEval compaction and retrieval reliability by filtering reasoning text from summaries, retrying truncated summaries, hardening delegated expansion, and falling back to raw-message search in shallow trees.

- [#205](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/205) [`ef4865f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/ef4865fb13a1a8e373a045c0dd2a907ae1bbbfde) Thanks [@aquaright1](https://github.com/aquaright1)! - Preserve assistant text and matched tool calls when pruning stale orphaned tool calls from assembled context.

- [#186](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/186) [`c796f7d`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c796f7d9d014a19f2b55e62895a32327b0347694) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Harden LCM summarization so provider auth failures no longer persist fallback summaries, and stop forcing explicit temperature overrides on summarizer requests.

- [#182](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/182) [`954a2fd`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/954a2fd848b6444561e26afc2b41ad01e27d5a08) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Improve `lcm-tui` session browsing by showing stable session keys in the session list and conversation header, and align the session list columns so message counts and LCM metadata are easier to scan.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- [#159](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/159) [`20b6c1b`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/20b6c1bd0c8c5903ce4498e9cef235392fa0cfc4) Thanks [@tmchow](https://github.com/tmchow)! - Fix legacy tool-call backfill for rows that stored ids under `metadata.raw.call_id`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/157) [`f3f0aa2`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/f3f0aa29e636542e47f5020a1d6759dff023d798) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add `lcm-tui doctor` command for auto-detecting and repairing truncation-fallback summaries. Features position-aware marker detection (rejects false positives from summaries that quote markers in narrative text), bottom-up repair ordering, OAuth/token CLI delegation, and transaction-safe dry-run mode.

- [#138](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/138) [`9047e49`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/9047e49a91db0e4cba83f4f1c11fc10a899e5528) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Add incremental bootstrap checkpoints and large tool-output externalization.

  This release speeds up restart/bootstrap by checkpointing session transcript state,
  skipping unchanged transcript replays, and using append-only tail imports when a
  session file only grew. It also externalizes oversized tool outputs into
  `large_files` with compact placeholders so long-running OpenClaw sessions keep
  their full recall surface without carrying giant inline tool payloads in the
  active transcript.

### Patch Changes

- [#156](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/156) [`968b1d6`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/968b1d6b2ff41a297645309aa7c1d7dc80bee7ab) Thanks [@jalehman](https://github.com/jalehman)! - Fix compaction auth failures: surface provider auth errors instead of silently aborting, fall back to deterministic truncation when summarizer returns empty content, fall through to legacy auth-profiles.json when modelAuth returns scope-limited credentials. TUI now sets WAL mode and busy_timeout to prevent SQLITE_BUSY during concurrent usage.

- [#129](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/129) [`133665c`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/133665c24d5e4bdd1ad01cd4373b65af5d37d868) Thanks [@semiok](https://github.com/semiok)! - Use LIKE search for full-text queries containing CJK characters. SQLite FTS5's `unicode61` tokenizer can return empty or incomplete results for Chinese/Japanese/Korean text, so CJK queries now bypass FTS and use the existing LIKE-based fallback for correct matches.

- [#132](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/132) [`4522a72`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/4522a7217511dc99be2576ac49cb216515213aea) Thanks [@hhe48203-ctrl](https://github.com/hhe48203-ctrl)! - Persist the resolved compaction summarization model on summary records instead of
  always showing `unknown`.

  Existing `summaries` rows keep the `unknown` fallback through an additive
  migration, while newly created summaries now record the actual model configured
  for compaction.

- [#126](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/126) [`437c240`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/437c240c580e0407f4732b401792bec10ab50f1b) Thanks [@cryptomaltese](https://github.com/cryptomaltese)! - Annotate attachment-only messages during compaction without dropping short captions.

  This release improves media-aware compaction summaries by replacing raw
  `MEDIA:/...` placeholders for attachment-only messages while still preserving
  real caption text, including short captions such as `Look at this!`, when a
  message also includes a media attachment.

- [#146](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/146) [`c37777f`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/c37777f416afb088f816fe1bb10b17773d08306f) Thanks [@qualiobra](https://github.com/qualiobra)! - Fix a session-queue cleanup race that could leak per-session queue entries during
  overlapping ingest or compaction operations.

- [#131](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/pull/131) [`bab46cc`](https://github.com/Martian-Engineering/lossless-claw/commit/bab46ccd633ee159443b965793cb83cb64f673a2) Thanks [@semiok](https://github.com/semiok)! - Add 60-second timeout protection to summarizer LLM calls. Previously, a slow or unresponsive model provider could block the `deps.complete()` call indefinitely, starving the Node.js event loop and causing downstream failures such as Telegram polling disconnects. Both the initial and retry summarization calls are now wrapped with a timeout that rejects cleanly and falls through to the existing deterministic fallback.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 45f714c: Add `expansionModel` and `expansionProvider` overrides for delegated
  `lcm_expand_query` subagent runs.
- 1e6812a: Add session scoping controls for ignored and stateless OpenClaw sessions,
  including cron and subagent pattern support, and make runtime summary model
  environment overrides win reliably over plugin config during compaction.

### Patch Changes

- 518a1b2: Restore automatic post-turn compaction when OpenClaw omits the top-level
  `tokenBudget`, by resolving fallback budget inputs consistently before using
  the default compaction budget.
- 6c54c7b: Declare explicit OpenClaw tool names for the LCM factory-registered tools so
  plugin metadata and tool listings stay populated in hosts that require
  `registerTool(..., { name })` hints for factory registrations.
- 9ee103a: Fix condensed summary expansion so replay walks the source summaries that were compacted into a node, and skip proactive compaction when turn ingest fails to avoid compacting a stale frontier.
- ae260f7: Fix the TUI Anthropic OAuth fallback so Claude CLI summaries respect the selected model and stay within the expected summary size budget.
- 8f77fe7: Run LCM migrations during engine startup and only advertise `ownsCompaction`
  when the database schema is operational, while preserving runtime compaction
  settings and accurate token accounting for structured tool results.
- 7fae41c: Fix assembler round-tripping for tool results so structured `tool_result` content is preserved and normalized tool metadata no longer inflates context token budgeting.
- ceee14e: Restore stable conversation continuity across OpenClaw session UUID recycling
  by resolving sessions through `sessionKey` for both writes and read-only
  lookups, and keep compaction/ingest serialization aligned with that stable
  identity.
- bbd2ecb: Emit LCM startup and configuration banner logs only once per process so
  repeated OpenClaw plugin registration during snapshot loads does not duplicate
  the same startup lines.
- 82becaf: Remove hardcoded non-LCM recall tool names from the dynamic summary prompt so
  agents rely on whatever memory tooling is actually available in the host
  session.
- 6b85751: Restore compatibility for existing OpenClaw sessions that still reference the
  legacy `default` context engine, and improve container deployments by adding a
  supported Docker image and startup flow for LCM-backed OpenClaw environments.
- 828d106: Improve LCM summarization model resolution so configured `summaryModel`
  overrides, OpenClaw `agents.defaults.compaction.model`, and newer
  `runtimeContext` inputs are honored more reliably while preserving
  compatibility with older `legacyCompactionParams` integrations.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f1dfa5c: Catch up the release notes for work merged after `0.2.8`.

  This release adds Anthropic OAuth setup-token support in the TUI, resolves
  SecretRef-backed auth-profile credentials and provider-level custom provider
  configuration during summarization, and formats LCM tool timestamps in the local
  timezone instead of UTC.
