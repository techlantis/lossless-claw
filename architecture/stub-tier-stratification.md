# LCM Stub-Tier Stratification

**Status:** Architecture proposal · pre-adversarial review
**Base:** `pr-613-newest` (= PR #613 v4.1 omnibus)
**Branch:** `feat/lcm-stub-tier-stratification`
**Author:** drafted with operator
**Last updated:** 2026-05-07

## 1. TL;DR

**Problem:** v4.1's stored conversations are dominated (53%) by tool-result payloads. Most tool results are large (>5k tokens), repeat across turns, and the model rarely needs to look at the full byte-stream of a 4-day-old `find` result. But every assemble walks through them, inflating the per-turn prompt and burning context.

**Proposal:** Separate the message *thread* (the semantic spine of the conversation) from the *payloads* (tool result bodies). The thread stays small. Payloads move to a content-addressable blob tier with stub references on the thread. Drill-down is by message-id via existing v4.1 tools (`lcm_describe expandMessages`, `lcm_grep --mode verbatim`).

```
BEFORE (v4.1):
  messages.content holds:
    - text messages (user, assistant) — naturally small
    - tool result bodies — often 10k-50k tokens each
  assemble() inlines all of these.

AFTER (stub-tier proposal):
  messages.content holds:
    - text messages (user, assistant) — unchanged
    - tool calls (the request) — unchanged, naturally small
    - tool results: STUB ("[tool_result blob_ref=blob_abc123 size=26585t kind=vm_status]")
      ← original body lives in lcm_blobs(blob_id, content, content_type, byte_size, token_count, ref_count)
  assemble() inlines stubs for tool results outside the inline window.
  Drill-down: lcm_describe(message_id, expandMessages=true) joins messages.blob_ref → lcm_blobs.content
```

**Expected outcome on operator's live DB:**
- Per-turn assembled token cost: ~155k → ~75-90k (–50%)
- DB row count unchanged; storage size unchanged (the bytes still live somewhere)
- No information loss — every byte still queryable by id
- No runtime API change — drill-down via existing v4.1 tool surface
- One-shot migration tool to convert existing tool messages to stubs (operator runs once after deploy)

---

## 2. Goals & non-goals

### 2.1 Goals

1. **G1 — Reduce per-turn assembled context cost by ≥40% on a real LCM with mature history**, measured against the v4.1 agent-harness DB (3,855 leaves, ~13M token corpus), without losing information.
2. **G2 — Lossless storage invariant preserved.** Every byte that v4.1 stores is still recoverable after migration; only its location and access pattern differ.
3. **G3 — Backward-compatible schema migration.** Existing rows continue to work without conversion. Operator can run a one-shot migration tool to convert historical tool messages to stubs at their convenience, on a schedule, or never.
4. **G4 — No new agent tools required.** Drill-down works via existing `lcm_describe(message_id, expandMessages=true)` and `lcm_grep --mode verbatim`. Both already exist in v4.1.
5. **G5 — Cache-stable.** Stub representation does not change between consecutive turns for the same message — prompt cache invalidations only happen when a message itself changes.
6. **G6 — Refcount-correct.** Blobs are deduplicated by content hash. Refcounts are updated atomically. Orphaned blobs (refcount=0) are GC'd by an explicit operator command, never automatically (lossless invariant).
7. **G7 — Migration is operator-controlled and idempotent.** No automatic background mutation of existing data. The operator triggers conversion via CLI, can dry-run, can scope by date range or by token threshold.
8. **G8 — Test parity with v4.1's agent-harness baseline.** `scripts/v41-qa-runner.mjs --suite full` must continue to return 30/30 against the migrated DB.

### 2.2 Non-goals

- **NG1 — Not changing the host (OpenClaw) at all.** This is a plugin-only change. Host's prompt assembly is unchanged.
- **NG2 — Not changing summary semantics.** Summaries continue to compress raw messages into condensed leaves. The blob tier is orthogonal: it just changes where the bytes live.
- **NG3 — Not deleting any data.** The blob tier is content-addressable storage with refcount; rows in `messages` and `summaries` continue to exist. The migration tool transforms `messages.content` from "full body" to "stub", but doesn't drop rows.
- **NG4 — Not making the model smarter or change its tool-call behavior.** This is purely about how the assembler emits the conversation thread.
- **NG5 — Not changing the public TypeScript API of `LcmContextEngine`.** New blob accessors are added; nothing existing is renamed or removed.

## 3. The problem in numbers (operator's live data)

From the audit of conversation 1872:

| Layer | Count | Tokens | % of stored |
|---|---|---|---|
| User messages | 1,890 | 630K | 5% |
| Assistant messages | 12,444 | 5.65M | 42% |
| **Tool result messages** | **12,212** | **7.04M** | **53%** |
| Total messages | 26,546 | 13.3M | 100% |
| Summaries (depth 0–3) | 624 | 655K | (separate) |

**Distribution of tool message sizes:**
| Size bucket | Count | Tokens |
|---|---|---|
| 0–1k | 9,500 | ~3M |
| 1k–5k | 2,200 | ~5M |
| 5k–10k | 250 | ~1.7M |
| 10k–20k | 46 | ~550K |
| 20k–50k | 16 | ~382K |

**Top single-message offenders** (sample): VM status outputs at 26.5k each (29 copies of similar pattern), image-read base64 at 26k each, session-jsonl reads at 23k each, debug-trace dumps repeated 4x in 2 minutes (clear bug).

**Stub-tier savings target:**
- For tool messages outside the inline window (last ~30 turns), replace body with ~30-token stub.
- Conservative: 12,000 of 12,212 tool messages stubbed × ~26 tokens average stub size ≈ 312K stub tokens (vs 7.04M body tokens) = **6.7M tokens saved on assemble** (when those 12k messages are in the assembled window).
- Per-turn savings depends on which tool messages happen to be in the assembled window. From recent assemble events: ~155k assembled, of which ~120k is tool/assistant content. Stubbing tool results outside the inline window cuts that in half on average.

## 4. Design

### 4.1 Schema additions (additive, no destructive changes)

```sql
-- New: blob tier (content-addressable storage)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lcm_blobs (
  blob_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- 'blob_' + sha256(content)[0..32]
  content        TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_type   TEXT NOT NULL,               -- e.g. 'tool_result/bash', 'tool_result/image', 'tool_result/file_read'
  byte_size      INTEGER NOT NULL,
  token_count    INTEGER NOT NULL,            -- precomputed via estimateTokens at insert
  ref_count      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,  -- number of messages referencing this blob
  created_at     TEXT NOT NULL,               -- ISO 8601
  source_role    TEXT,                        -- 'tool' | 'assistant_thinking' | etc. (informational)
  CHECK (ref_count >= 0)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS lcm_blobs_content_type_idx ON lcm_blobs(content_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS lcm_blobs_created_at_idx ON lcm_blobs(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS lcm_blobs_size_idx ON lcm_blobs(token_count DESC);

-- Modify: messages table gets two new nullable columns
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN blob_ref TEXT;  -- when set, content is the stub representation
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN inline_window_pin INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;  -- 1 = always inline regardless of age (operator-pinnable)

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS messages_blob_ref_idx ON messages(blob_ref) WHERE blob_ref IS NOT NULL;

-- New: blob GC log (when operator runs purge-orphans, log what was removed for auditability)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lcm_blob_gc_log (
  log_id        INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  blob_id       TEXT NOT NULL,
  byte_size     INTEGER NOT NULL,
  token_count   INTEGER NOT NULL,
  reason        TEXT NOT NULL,             -- 'refcount_zero' | 'manual_force' | etc.
  removed_at    TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

**Migration order (idempotent):**
1. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lcm_blobs
2. ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN blob_ref (NULLable, default NULL)
3. ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN inline_window_pin (default 0)
4. CREATE INDEXES IF NOT EXISTS

These run on every plugin load through the existing `runLcmMigrations` flow; existing rows are unaffected (blob_ref stays NULL → assemble inlines content as before).

### 4.2 Stub format (thread-side)

When a message is converted to use the blob tier, its `content` becomes a **stable, deterministic stub**:

```
[tool_result blob_ref=blob_<sha256-prefix> size_tokens=<N> kind=<content_type> drilldown=lcm_describe(messageId=<id>,expandMessages=true)]
```

Concrete example (a 26,585-token VM status output):
```
[tool_result blob_ref=blob_a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678 size_tokens=26585 kind=tool_result/bash drilldown=lcm_describe(messageId=531655,expandMessages=true)]
```

**Stub size:** ~150–250 chars (~30–60 tokens). Constant across turns regardless of underlying body size.

**Stub stability:** the stub is fully derivable from `(blob_id, token_count, content_type, message_id)`. None of these change between consecutive assembles → cache-stable.

**Why include the drill-down hint inline?** So the model sees the exact tool call needed to recover the body without extra inference. Mirrors the v4.1 design philosophy of putting actionable hints in tool results (cf. `catalogStatus`, `confidenceBand` from PR #613's bug fixes).

### 4.3 Inline window (which tool results stay inline vs stubbed)

The assembler decides per-message whether to inline the full body or emit the stub. Three rules, in priority order:

1. **`inline_window_pin = 1`** → always inline (operator can pin specific messages, e.g., critical instructions).
2. **Within fresh tail** (the last `freshTailCount` messages or `freshTailMaxTokens`, same as today) → always inline. The model needs immediate-history fidelity.
3. **Outside fresh tail** → if `blob_ref IS NOT NULL`, emit stub. Else inline (legacy uncoverted messages).

Configuration knobs (added to `LcmConfig`):
```typescript
{
  blobTier: {
    enabled: boolean,           // default true; false reverts to v4.1 inlining behavior
    stubFormatVersion: 1,        // future-proof
  }
}
```

The inline window is **the same fresh tail v4.1 already defines** — no new configuration. Eligibility for stubbing is purely "is this message in the fresh tail or not?"

### 4.4 Migration tool (one-shot, operator-triggered)

New CLI: `npx tsx scripts/lcm-blob-migrate.mjs`

Flags:
- `--db <path>` — required
- `--dry-run` — report what would happen, don't write
- `--min-tokens <N>` — only migrate messages with `token_count >= N` (default: 1000; rationale: small messages save little but doubling the row count is bad — TBD-tunable)
- `--role <role>` — restrict to e.g. `tool` (default: `tool`); never migrates user/assistant text
- `--before-date <iso>` — only migrate messages older than the given date (default: 30 days ago — out of fresh tail of any reasonable session)
- `--conversation-id <id>` — restrict to a single conversation (for testing)
- `--vacuum` — run `VACUUM` on the DB after migration to reclaim space (optional; expensive on large DBs)

Migration step (per matching message):
1. Compute `blob_id = 'blob_' + sha256(content)[0..32]`
2. `INSERT INTO lcm_blobs (...) ON CONFLICT(blob_id) DO UPDATE SET ref_count = ref_count + 1`
3. `UPDATE messages SET content = '<stub>', blob_ref = <blob_id> WHERE message_id = ?`
4. Log the conversion in a new table `lcm_blob_migration_log` (per-row audit trail)

Idempotent: rerunning is a no-op for already-migrated messages (because their content is already the stub format). Stubs are recognized by a sentinel prefix `[tool_result blob_ref=`.

Atomic: each message conversion is a single DB transaction. If the script crashes mid-run, partial migration is safe (other rows still untouched, already-migrated rows recognized as such).

### 4.5 Drill-down (already exists)

The agent uses **existing v4.1 tools** to recover blob content:

- `lcm_describe(messageId, expandMessages=true)` — when given a message id whose content is a stub, joins to `lcm_blobs.content` and returns the original body.
- `lcm_grep --mode verbatim` — searches the **blob content** (not just message stubs); matches return original body.
- `lcm_get_entity` / `lcm_synthesize_around` — unchanged; their internal queries already work against the message table and don't need blob-aware behavior (they never emit raw tool result content directly).

These tools' implementations are updated to do the join automatically when they encounter a `blob_ref`. No agent-visible API change.

### 4.6 Refcount integrity

**Increment rules:**
- Every `INSERT` into `messages` with `blob_ref = X` → atomically `UPDATE lcm_blobs SET ref_count = ref_count + 1 WHERE blob_id = X` (in same transaction).

**Decrement rules:**
- Every `DELETE FROM messages WHERE blob_ref = X` → atomically `UPDATE lcm_blobs SET ref_count = ref_count - 1 WHERE blob_id = X`.
- Every `UPDATE messages SET blob_ref = NULL WHERE blob_ref = X` → atomic decrement.
- Every `UPDATE messages SET blob_ref = Y` (changing ref) → decrement old, increment new.

**GC:** orphan blobs (refcount = 0) are NEVER auto-deleted. Operator runs `lcm-blob-migrate.mjs --purge-orphans` to delete (with audit log to `lcm_blob_gc_log`).

**Triggers** to enforce atomicity at SQL layer:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS messages_blob_insert_trigger
  AFTER INSERT ON messages
  WHEN NEW.blob_ref IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
  UPDATE lcm_blobs SET ref_count = ref_count + 1 WHERE blob_id = NEW.blob_ref;
END;

CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS messages_blob_delete_trigger
  AFTER DELETE ON messages
  WHEN OLD.blob_ref IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
  UPDATE lcm_blobs SET ref_count = ref_count - 1 WHERE blob_id = OLD.blob_ref;
END;

CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS messages_blob_update_trigger
  AFTER UPDATE OF blob_ref ON messages
BEGIN
  -- Decrement old ref if it was set
  UPDATE lcm_blobs SET ref_count = ref_count - 1 WHERE blob_id = OLD.blob_ref AND OLD.blob_ref IS NOT NULL;
  -- Increment new ref if it's being set
  UPDATE lcm_blobs SET ref_count = ref_count + 1 WHERE blob_id = NEW.blob_ref AND NEW.blob_ref IS NOT NULL;
END;
```

This guarantees refcount integrity at the SQL level, even if application code paths miss a manual update. Triggers run inside the same transaction as the message mutation.

### 4.7 Cache invalidation correctness

The model's prompt cache is keyed by the prompt prefix. To preserve cache stability:

- A message's stub representation is **deterministic** — same `(blob_id, token_count, content_type, message_id)` always produces the same stub string.
- The transition from "inline body" to "stub" happens at migration time (one-shot). Once migrated, the assembled prompt for that message position is stable across consecutive turns.
- The fresh-tail boundary moves as new messages arrive, but messages enter the tail with their original content; only the boundary changes, not the per-message rendering of any individual message at a fixed position.

**One subtle case:** when a message that was inline now falls outside the fresh tail (because new messages have pushed it out), its assemble representation changes inline-to-stub. This invalidates the prefix cache from that position forward. **This already happens in v4.1** — when a message gets summarized, the same cache invalidation occurs. Behavior matches existing v4.1 semantics.

### 4.8 Edge cases

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| Message has `blob_ref` set but blob doesn't exist (orphan reference) | Assembler logs a warning, falls back to "[blob_ref=X (missing)]" stub; agent can't drill down. Operator can fix via `lcm-blob-migrate.mjs --reconcile-refs`. |
| Two messages have identical content | After migration, both have the same `blob_ref`; refcount = 2. If one is deleted, refcount drops to 1; blob remains. |
| Very small tool message (e.g., 50 tokens) | Below `--min-tokens` threshold (default 1000); never migrated. Stays inline. |
| Tool message in fresh tail | Always inlined regardless of `blob_ref`. Migration safe; assembler chooses based on position. |
| Message content was already a stub before migration | Detected by sentinel prefix `[tool_result blob_ref=`. Migration skips. |
| Subagent or stateless session | The session-pattern filters at the top of `afterTurn` already exclude these from compaction; stub migration only runs on conversations that pass those filters. |
| Embedding-meta references | `lcm_embedding_meta` rows reference summaries (not raw messages) by `summary_id`. Unaffected by blob migration — embeddings continue to work against the summarized representation. |
| Entity mentions | `lcm_entity_mentions.message_id` may reference a message whose content is now a stub. Lookup still works (joins on message_id), but if a downstream tool wants the body it must drill down via `lcm_blobs`. **`lcm_get_entity` will need to be updated** to do the join automatically. |
| FTS5 index on messages.content | After migration, the FTS index points at the stub, not the body. **Must re-index FTS to include `lcm_blobs.content` content.** Alternative: build a new virtual table that views `messages` joined with `lcm_blobs.content`. Decided in §4.10 below. |
| Backup/restore | Both tables backed up together. SQLite VACUUM works fine on both. No external blob storage. |

### 4.9 FTS5 index implications

v4.1 has FTS5 indexes on messages and summaries for `lcm_grep --mode full_text`. After blob migration, the messages FTS would index stubs, not bodies — semantic searches would miss matches.

**Two options considered:**

**Option A (chosen):** Add a second FTS table over blobs and have `lcm_grep` query both.
```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS lcm_blobs_fts USING fts5(
  blob_id UNINDEXED,
  content,
  tokenize='unicode61'
);
-- triggers to keep it sync'd with lcm_blobs
```
`lcm_grep --mode full_text` queries both `messages_fts` and `lcm_blobs_fts`, joins blobs back to their referencing messages, and returns unified hits.

**Option B (rejected):** Update messages FTS triggers to JOIN against blobs at index time. Heavier; requires ALTER on existing FTS (not supported in SQLite without rebuild).

Option A is implementation-cheap and preserves v4.1's existing FTS semantics. Documented in implementation plan §6.

### 4.10 Performance projections

**Migration cost (one-shot):**
- Test DB has ~12,000 tool messages averaging 500 bytes each (smaller mean than the operator's live DB; many small messages dominate).
- Per-row migration: 1 SELECT + 1 INSERT/UPDATE blob + 1 UPDATE message + 1 trigger. ~1ms per row inside a transaction.
- 12,000 rows × 1ms = ~12 seconds. Plus optional VACUUM (which on a 2.6 GB DB takes ~30-60s).
- Total: ~1-2 minutes. Acceptable for an operator-triggered command.

**Steady-state assembly cost:**
- Today's assemble: ~155k tokens output at ~50ms.
- After migration: ~75-90k tokens output. Same wall-clock latency or slightly faster (less string concatenation).
- The blob join during drill-down (`lcm_describe expandMessages`): one indexed lookup. <1ms.

**Storage:**
- DB file size unchanged (the bytes still live somewhere). Plus a few MB for indexes and triggers.
- Eventual reclamation possible via `--purge-orphans` after operator confirms unused content.

### 4.11 Test plan (per goal)

| Goal | How verified |
|---|---|
| G1 — ≥40% per-turn assembled cost reduction | Run `scripts/v41-qa-runner.mjs --suite full --measure-tokens` against migrated DB; compare to v4.1 baseline |
| G2 — Lossless invariant | Round-trip: for every migrated message, drill down via `lcm_describe expandMessages=true` and verify exact byte match against pre-migration content. Regression test: `test/stub-tier.test.ts` |
| G3 — Backward-compat schema | Run v4.1 test suite (1533 tests) against migrated DB without any code changes; all must pass. New tests added on top. |
| G4 — No new tools | Verify by code review: no new entries in `openclaw.plugin.json contracts.tools`. |
| G5 — Cache stability | Snapshot the assembled prompt for a fixed `currentTokenCount` across two consecutive afterTurn calls; verify the prefix is byte-identical (no spurious stub differences). Regression test: `test/stub-tier.test.ts` |
| G6 — Refcount correctness | Test: insert 10 messages referencing same blob; refcount=10. Delete 5; refcount=5. Update 1 to point at different blob; old refcount=4, new=1. Run trigger-based and application-code paths separately. Regression test: `test/stub-tier.test.ts` |
| G7 — Migration idempotency | Run migration tool 3x on same DB; row counts and blob counts must match after each run. Regression test: `test/stub-tier.test.ts` |
| G8 — Test parity | `scripts/v41-qa-runner.mjs --suite full` on migrated DB returns 30/30 (same as v4.1 baseline) |

### 4.12 Implementation phases

1. **Phase A — Schema + types** (≤200 LOC): migration definitions, TypeScript types for `lcm_blobs`, refcount triggers.
2. **Phase B — Stub format + assembler** (≤300 LOC): `formatStub(blob)`, `parseStub(content)`, assembler emits stubs for non-fresh-tail messages with `blob_ref`.
3. **Phase C — Drill-down adapters in tools** (≤150 LOC): `lcm_describe` and `lcm_grep --mode verbatim` join through `lcm_blobs` when they encounter a `blob_ref`.
4. **Phase D — Migration CLI** (≤300 LOC): `scripts/lcm-blob-migrate.mjs` with `--dry-run`, `--min-tokens`, `--before-date`, `--vacuum`, `--purge-orphans`.
5. **Phase E — FTS adapter** (≤100 LOC): `lcm_blobs_fts` virtual table + triggers + `lcm_grep --mode full_text` union.
6. **Phase F — Tests** (~600 LOC): per the test plan above.

**Total estimated diff: ~1,650 LOC of additions, no destructive changes.**

## 5. Cross-cutting concerns

### 5.1 Privacy / data handling

Blob content is stored in the same SQLite DB as before. No new external data store. No data crosses process boundaries that didn't already cross them.

### 5.2 Multi-conversation / cross-conv blob sharing

The blob tier is conversation-agnostic. If two different conversations both produce identical tool results (e.g., `ls /etc`), they share a single blob row. This is intentional and free deduplication. Refcount tracks the total references across all conversations.

### 5.3 Suppression cascade

v4.1 has a suppression cascade (`suppressed_at` columns, soft-delete). When a message is suppressed, its referenced blob's refcount stays at the same value (suppression ≠ deletion). If the message is later HARD-deleted, the trigger decrements. Handled by the existing trigger; no special handling needed.

### 5.4 Forward compatibility

`stubFormatVersion: 1` in the config field allows for future stub format evolution. Adding a new stub field is additive: old stubs still parse, parsing logic detects version 1 vs unspecified.

### 5.5 What if the operator doesn't migrate?

Then nothing changes. v4.1 behavior is preserved exactly. The `blob_ref` column stays NULL on every row, and the assembler inlines content as before.

The only change is the schema gains some new tables and columns, all with safe defaults. Users who don't run the migration tool see no behavioral difference.

---

## 6. Implementation plan (post-adversarial-review)

Per phase above. Each phase should:
1. Land its source changes.
2. Land its tests; verify all 1533+ tests still pass plus new ones.
3. Be reviewable independently.

Build order: A → B → C → D → E → F.

PR will be **stacked** — A merges first as a small, schema-only change with no behavior shift. Subsequent phases each layer functionality.

Final integration test: run `scripts/v41-qa-runner.mjs --suite full --measure-tokens` against a fresh agent-harness DB with the migration tool applied; confirm 30/30 + measured token reduction ≥ 40%.

---

## 7. Open questions (for adversarial review)

1. **Default `--min-tokens` threshold** — should it be 1000? 500? Setting too low doubles the row count for marginal savings.
2. **Should user/assistant messages ever be migrated?** Currently `--role tool` only. Some assistant messages contain large code blocks. But assistant content is more semantically valuable; stubbing it would break in-context recall.
3. **What about `text/thinking` blocks within assistant messages?** v4.1 already strips them in some paths via `removedToolUseBlocks`. Should thinking content go to blobs? Probably not — thinking is the model's reasoning process, structurally part of the assistant turn.
4. **Garbage collection cadence** — should there be an opt-in `--gc-after` option that auto-purges orphans after each migration run? Current proposal: never auto-GC; always operator-controlled.
5. **Inline window granularity** — currently uses the same `freshTailCount`/`freshTailMaxTokens` as v4.1. Should there be a separate `inlineToolWindow` config that's independently tunable? Proposal: not for the initial stub-tier implementation; revisit later if usage patterns demand it.
6. **What if a tool result's content varies between calls** (e.g., `date` returns different content each time)? Each call produces a new blob with its own hash. Refcount = 1. Free; no special handling.

---

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Refcount drift due to bugs | Low | High (orphans waste storage) | SQL-level triggers (not just app code); periodic reconciler script; explicit `--reconcile-refs` operator command |
| FTS adapter misses tokens | Medium | Medium (search recall regression) | Add `lcm_blobs_fts` with same tokenizer; merge results with messages_fts in `lcm_grep`; existing P7 sanitizer applies |
| Migration corrupts large DB | Low | Critical (data loss) | All operations transactional; idempotent; operator MUST backup before run; `--dry-run` mandatory first |
| Cache invalidation thrashing | Low | Medium (cost regression) | Stub format deterministic; only-changes-on-migration; same invariants as v4.1 fresh-tail boundary |
| Drill-down latency hurts UX | Low | Low (one indexed lookup) | Blob lookup is O(1) by primary key; <1ms; no cross-process I/O |
| Operator forgets about pinning | Medium | Low | `inline_window_pin` is optional and additive; defaults to 0 (never pinned). Documented in CHANGELOG. |

---

## 9. What this is NOT

- Not a replacement for compaction. Summaries continue to operate on raw messages. Blobs are orthogonal: where the message body lives.
- Not a deletion tool. Nothing is removed; bytes just move from `messages.content` to `lcm_blobs.content`.
- Not a "compress old data" feature. Existing summarization handles compression. This is about cleanly separating thread vs payloads.
- Not an attempt to reduce DB file size on disk. Until VACUUM runs, file size is unchanged. This is about *assembled context cost*, not *storage cost*.

---

## 10. Acceptance criteria for merge

The stub-tier PR can be merged when:

1. Architecture review (this document) passes adversarial review with no blocking findings.
2. All 1533 v4.1 tests still pass.
3. New tests cover G1–G8 (≥30 new tests).
4. `scripts/v41-qa-runner.mjs --suite full` reports 30/30 against migrated DB.
5. `scripts/v41-qa-runner.mjs --suite full --measure-tokens` reports ≥40% reduction in assembled token cost.
6. Migration tool round-trip: every migrated message's `lcm_describe expandMessages=true` returns byte-identical content.
7. Documentation updates: README, configuration.md, agent-tools.md.
