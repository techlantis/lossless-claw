# Decision: stub-tier mitigations

## Context

After the Opus subagent A/B comparison of the baseline (333 blocks) vs stub-tier (689 blocks at full migration; 421 in our partial-migration test) at the same 258K-token budget, four mitigations were recommended to address moderate-risk findings (stale-info, cognitive load, stub legibility):

1. Recency cue `[t-NNm]` on turn headers
2. Semantic stub wrapping `<lcm-stub …>` XML tags
3. Empty-assistant collapsing
4. Resolution markers at completion boundaries

We applied the first-principles-architectural-decision skill (Step 1: research, Step 1.5: run-the-system, Step 2: where-it-lives, Step 3: adversarial debate) before deciding to build any of them.

## Decision

**REJECT ALL FOUR.** Stay with the stub-tier implementation as currently shipped (Options C + D + F at commit `e309bed`).

## Rationale

### #1 — Recency cue `[t-NNm]` — REJECT

**Empirical finding (Step 1):** User messages already carry absolute timestamps in prefix form: `[Thu 2026-04-09 01:38 GMT+7]`. Counted 55 in baseline, 71 in the stub-tier variant (one per user turn). The agent already has the recency signal it needs.

**Architectural failure (Step 2 diagram):** A `[t-NNm]` tag is a function of `now()` at assemble time. The same conversation prefix produces a different rendered string on every assembly. This invalidates the Anthropic prompt cache prefix all the way back to the first turn, on every single request. The stub-tier implementation's whole value proposition (689 items at same budget) is amortized via prefix caching. Burning the cache to add information already present in the prefix is strictly negative ROI.

**Adversarial verdict:** FOR position 85% confidence ("low-cost insurance against unobserved failure mode"). AGAINST position ≥95% confidence (cache thrashing + redundant data). AGAINST wins decisively.

### #2 — Semantic stub wrapping `<lcm-stub>` XML — REJECT

**Empirical finding (Step 1.5):** The existing `[LCM Tool Output: file_xxx | tool=… | N bytes]` format works in our live Opus test. Opus correctly identifies stubs, matches user references to fileIds (after Option F's tool_input disambiguator), and writes the correct `lcm_describe(id="file_xxx")` call. The format has been in production since v4.1 (3 stubs use it in baseline transcript).

**Architectural failure:** Switching to a novel `<lcm-stub fileId=…>` invents a token sequence the model has not seen, and bets that "XML structure" outperforms a working format. The case FOR was admitted to be weak (~85% from the FOR agent itself: "future-proofing for richer metadata"). The semantic content (file id, tool name, byte count, drilldown instruction) is already present in the bracket form.

**Adversarial verdict:** FOR position couldn't reach 95%. AGAINST position 92%. Format works; novelty is cost without observed benefit.

### #3 — Empty-assistant collapsing — REJECT

**Empirical finding (Step 1):** ~39-40% of assistant turns are empty after stripping the rendered ` ```tool_use``` ` fences (177 -> 71 in baseline; 249 -> 98 in the stub-tier variant; ~identical proportion). Statistically significant.

**Architectural failure (Step 2 diagram):** The wire-format contract requires `tool_use` blocks to live in assistant turns; `tool_result` blocks pair to them by `toolCallId`. The Anthropic / OpenAI API will reject a `tool_result` whose preceding assistant turn doesn't carry the matching `tool_use`. The "empty" rendering in our dump is a display artifact — the assembler emits content arrays containing tool_use blocks; the dump renderer chose to elide them visually but they exist in the API payload.

**Two interpretations of the mitigation, both fail:**
- If "collapse" = render-time only → it's already happening (those blocks render empty in our dump). No-op.
- If "collapse" = drop tool_use blocks from the API payload → breaks provider contracts; the `toolCallId` on every tool_result line proves the pairing requirement. Producers reject orphan tool_results.

**Adversarial verdict:** FOR position 90% (real statistical evidence of empty turns). AGAINST position ≥95% (wire-contract is non-negotiable). AGAINST wins.

### #4 — Resolution markers — REJECT

**Empirical finding (Step 1):** No reliable signal exists for "work completed" in the actual transcript. User turns include `"go ahead"`, `"Yes, go ahead"`, `"keep digging"`, `"Do not come back to me; go autonomous"` — none mark completion; several look like completion phrases but authorize more work. Conversation oscillates with no clean boundary.

**Architectural failure:** The mitigation requires deciding WHEN to inject a synthetic system block. Heuristic options:
- PR merge events: agent isn't doing PR work in this session
- "User said 'fixed'": doesn't appear in either dump
- "User changed topic": false positives every time user pauses mid-problem
- Explicit annotation: 0% of real users will manually mark completion

False positives are strictly worse than no marker — they license premature stubbing of context that's still load-bearing.

**Adversarial verdict:** FOR position 70% (inferred future optimization). AGAINST position ≥95% (no shippable trigger). AGAINST wins.

## Counter-arguments considered

**FOR #1 strongest case:** "Low-cost insurance against unobserved stale-info risk."
- Rebuttal: cache thrashing is observable cost; stale-info is theoretical. Trading observed cost for theoretical benefit is strictly negative.

**FOR #3 strongest case:** "39% of assistant turns are empty — pure compression win."
- Rebuttal: the bytes attributed to "empty turns" are actually tool_use blocks (required by provider contracts). The dump renderer elides them; the API payload contains them. The "savings" are illusory.

**FOR #4 strongest case:** "Resolution markers help LCM make smarter eviction decisions."
- Rebuttal: even if true, there's no reliable signal to detect resolution. False positives cause premature eviction of load-bearing context — worse than current behavior.

## Risks accepted by rejecting all four

1. **Stale-info on user prompts that don't reference timestamps:** mitigated by the timestamps already in user prefixes. If observed in production, can revisit with a CACHE-STABLE recency signal (e.g., turn-position-based instead of clock-based).
2. **Cognitive load from 88 more blocks at same budget:** Opus's analysis showed signal-to-noise unchanged. If observed in production, address by raising the per-row stub threshold from 8KB to 16KB (ships fewer stubs).
3. **Stub legibility on a future model that hasn't seen the v4.1 format:** if the model ever fails to recognize `[LCM Tool Output:]`, the issue surfaces clearly (no drilldown calls), and we revisit.

## Open questions deferred

- **Live runtime drilldown rate measurement:** post-merge, in a controlled session, count how often agents invoke `lcm_describe(file_xxx)` when stubs are present. Pass: ≥70% on conversational queries that reference specific elided tool calls. This is the gating signal for default-on rollout.
- **JOIN cost of `getLargeFile()` lookups in `resolveMessageItem`** on a 2.6GB DB: needs benchmarking. Currently bench shows 124ms total assemble time, so likely fine, but worth measuring at scale.

## Reversibility

Rejecting these mitigations is fully reversible:

- If stale-info actually fires in production, build a cache-stable recency signal (e.g., turn-relative `[turn -47]` instead of clock-relative `[t-12m]`) — that's a different mitigation than #1.
- If a future model fails to recognize the bracket format, ship Option G (LLM-generated exploration summaries instead of tool_input disambiguators) which gives the agent semantic content rather than format recognition.
- Empty-assistant work can be revisited as a v4.1 cleanup PR (separate from stub-tier, addresses both variants equally).
- Resolution markers can be revisited if/when explicit user annotations become a workflow primitive elsewhere in OpenClaw.

None of these would compete with the stub-tier work that's shipped.

## Conclusion

The current stub-tier implementation (Options C + D + F at commit `e309bed`) is the right shipping shape. Each proposed mitigation either:
- Adds cost without observed benefit (#1 cache thrash; #2 novel format)
- Conflates rendered transcript with API payload (#3 wire-contract)
- Has no reliable trigger condition (#4 detection)

Empirical drilldown validation is the remaining gating signal, and that's a post-merge live-runtime test, not a pre-merge architectural change.
